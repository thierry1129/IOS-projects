I implemented the shopping calculator, it should work fine. I consider discount larger than 100 percent to be possible so there will be negative final price if discount percentage is larger than 100%. 


Error message will be shown if users are trying to enter non- numbers in the text field ( except for the name field for the extra credit portion. ) 

error messages will also be shown if negative values are entered in the textfields 

Extra credit. 

I implemented a simple price comparator, users can just type in the name of the product that they just calculated the price for, and click on the three buttons to search on online retailers.
